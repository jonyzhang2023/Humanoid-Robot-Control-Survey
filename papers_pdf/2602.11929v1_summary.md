## Abstract (from PDF parsing)
Learning a general whole-body controller for humanoid robots remains challenging due to the diversity of motion distributions, the difficulty of fast adaptation, and the need for robust balance in high-dynamic scenarios. Existing approaches often require task-specific training or suffer from performance degradation when adapting to new motions. In this paper, we present FAST, a general humanoid whole-body control framework that enables Fast Adaptation and Stable Motion Tracking. FAST introduces Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation, which learns a lightweight delta action policy under orthogonality and KL constraints, enabling efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution motions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further improve physical robustness, we propose Center-of-Mass-Aware Control, which incorporates CoM-related observations and objectives to enhance balance when tracking challenging reference motions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world deployment demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in robustness, adaptation efficiency, and generalization. Date: February 12, 2026 1 Introduction In robotics, achieving general whole-body control (WBC) is a critical step toward advancing humanoid intelligence. Rather than mastering isolated skills [1, 2], general WBC aims to extend the boundary of controllable motions and coordination patterns, enabling a single controller to execute diverse whole-body behaviors [3]. Suc...

## Method / Approach (Snippets)
We present a unified framework, FAST, for general humanoid whole-body control that combines large-scale motion pretraining with stable and efficient policy adaptation, as illustrated in Figure 2. A motion tracking policy is trained to follow diverse reference motions while explicitly regulating balance and stability through Center-of-Mass–Aware objectives and observations. To enable fast specialization to new motion distributions, we introduce a residual adaptation scheme with Parseval regularization and KL-constrained updates, allowing efficient adaptation without degrading previously learned behaviors. 3.1 Motion Dataset Curation Human-to-Humanoid Retargeting. We construct a large-scale humanoid motion dataset by retargeting publicly available human motion capture datasets, including AMASS [7] and OMOMO [8], represented in the SMPL format. Additionally, we also collect a small in-house dataset using our own MoCap system. The retargeting and PHC-filtering process follows the previous work [23]. These datasets are used mainly for the 4  large-scale pretraining of the general whole-body controller. To evaluate fast adaptation and cross-distribution generalization, we additionally incorporate in-house motion data collected via Inertial Motion Capture, together with LaFan1 [9] and MotionX [33], which contain more dynamic and device-specific motion patterns. Data Augmentation for Motion Diversity. To enhance motion diversity and robustness to distribution shifts, we augment retar...

## Conclusion (Snippets)
In this work, we present FAST, a general humanoid whole- body control framework that emphasizes fast adaptation and stable motion tracking. FAST combines Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation to efficiently specialize a pre- trained policy to new motion distributions while constraining policy drift, with Center-of-Mass-Aware Control to enhance stability when tracking high-dynamic or low-quality reference motions. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robustness, adaptability, and generalization across diverse scenarios, including motion capture tracking, text- and video-derived motions, and real-time teleoperation. Future work will explore fully online and continual adaptation, as well as more adaptive regularization strategies to further balance stability and flexibility. 11...

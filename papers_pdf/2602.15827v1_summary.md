## Method / Approach (Snippets)
distances trigger varying stride phases and entry poses. (b) Diverse locomotion speeds, directions, and durations. (c) Ran- domized terrain poses and shapes. Dataset construction. We synthesize long-horizon refer- ence trajectories by rolling out the motion-matching compo- sition procedure as follows. As visualized in Fig. 3(b), each trajectory starts from a standing state and enters a locomotion phase driven by 2D velocity commands sampled from two speed levels (low (1m/s), high (2m/s)) and five turning direc- tions (−90◦, −45◦, 0◦, 45◦, 90◦). We then transition into skill k and replay the skill clip sequentially; during the skill, we set the command to go straight (0◦) while keeping the same speed level as the preceding locomotion segment. After reaching the annotated end frame ek, we return to locomotion and continue for an additional 2 seconds before stopping. Through- out synthesis, we record the per-timestep velocity commands alongside the generated kinematic reference poses {qt}, and use these paired trajectories for subsequent policy training. Transition Density. Motion matching naturally induces a high density of transitions by allowing a skill to be entered from multiple locomotion states that are nearby in the motion feature space. We exploit this to generate diverse skill en- trances spanning different approach distances and stride phases (e.g., adding a preparatory step before a jump, or initiating a vault from different phases of a running gait), densifying the ...

## Conclusion (Snippets)
We have presented Perceptive Humanoid Parkour, a modular framework that enables humanoid robots to autonomously execute long-horizon, highly dynamic parkour behaviors using onboard perception. By combining motion-matching-based skill composition with a teacher-student RL pipeline, our ap- proach preserves the agility of human motions while enabling perception-driven adaptation to diverse obstacles. We find that dense motion matching is critical in providing coherent long-horizon references and exposes the policy to a wide range of approach conditions, while augmenting distillation with RL transfers the capability from single-skill, privileged- information experts to the multi-skill, depth-based student efficiently. Through extensive simulation studies and zero-shot deployment on a Unitree G1 robot, we demonstrate state-of- the-art agile, adaptive, whole-body parkour in the real world. While our pipeline enables long-horizon, highly dynamic humanoid parkour, it currently lacks semantic ...

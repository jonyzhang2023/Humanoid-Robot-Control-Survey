## Conclusion (Snippets)
In this work, we presented a novel approach to optimize impact-robust postures as a task residual inside TSID for kinematically redundant robots. Our results show that the optimized posture effectively reduces spikes during impact events, which avoids control saturations and infeasibilities. Consequently, this leads to smoother robot state profiles (joint positions and velocities) that minimize robot motion during impacts, resulting in safer and more stable robot  (a) Impact-robust TSID optimizes for a posture with lower upper-body momentum to compensate for the impact. (b) Nominal TSID exerts higher upper-body angular momentum to com- pensate for the impact.

Our method complements state-of-the-art methods in impact handling whenever kinematic redundancy is not exhausted, which is useful for highly dimensional multi- contact robotic systems.

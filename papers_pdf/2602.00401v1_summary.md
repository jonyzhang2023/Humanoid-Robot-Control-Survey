## Method / Approach (Snippets)
We now present the technical details of ZEST. This section details its architecture, as illustrated in Figure 3, with a primary focus on the goal-conditioned MDP formulation. We describe the core components of this framework, including modeling, curation of the reference mo- tion dataset, the training setup, and the policy deployment process on hardware. Systems and Modeling We evaluated ZEST using three robots with different morphologies: the full-scale Boston Dynamics Atlas humanoid (30 DoF, 1.8m, 100kg), the smaller Unitree G1 humanoid (29 DoF, 1.2m, 35kg), and the Boston Dynamics Spot quadruped (12 DoF, 33kg). Our RL approach uses the Isaac Lab simulator [56]. However, a primary challenge for humanoids is to efficiently model the Parallel-Linkage Actuator (PLA), which is used in ankles, knees, and waists. While a crucial design for dynamic performance, simulating their closed-chain mechanisms results in stiff dynamics that are computationally expensive to calculate. To resolve the trade-off between simulation fidelity and computational efficiency, we developed a series of progressive approximations for the PLAs. A brief overview of these models is provided below, with the approach illustrated in Figure 4. Detailed mathematical derivations are available in the Supplementary Materials (Section S2). 1. Locally Projected Model (Massless-Links Approx.): Our first approximation is motivated by the lightweight design of the PLA’s support links. We assume these links are massless...

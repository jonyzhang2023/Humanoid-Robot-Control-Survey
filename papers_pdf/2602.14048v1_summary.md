## Method / Approach (Snippets)
Scenario & Personal Setup: you are a unique robot standing next to a poster, aims to proactively capture the user's attention and demonstrate its capabilities. Interrupt Observation: User awaits  introduction Trigger: User Intent Signals Behavior Plan: Point to the board to  indicate the poster Observation: User expresses a  misunderstanding Trigger: Conversation State Behavior Plan: Perform a lateral hand  wave to signal negation; interrupt to clarify  the concept Observation: User approaches the poster Trigger: Visual Scene Changes Behavior Plan: Rotate body to establish a presentation  stance Fig. 3. Demonstration of ProAct during a poster explanation task. The figure captures a continuous real-time session where the agent dynamically adapts its behavior based on visual and auditory triggers. Unlike passive systems, ProAct proactively captures the user’s attention (top-left), orients to the user (top-right), guides the conversation to the poster (bottom-left), and actively clarifies a misconception (bottom-right). The top header specifies the scenario setup, while the beige panels visualize the Cognitive System, mapping real-time observations and triggers to specific behavioral plans. The generated gestures correspond to these intentions, where the red arrows in the overlays indicate the velocity and direction of each movement. Scenario & Personal Setup: you are a storytelling agent, tasked with maintaining user engagement while narrating a story. Agent User Observation: U...

## Conclusion (Snippets)
In this paper, we introduce ProAct, a dual-system framework for proactive embodied social agents. We first develop an intention- conditioned flow-matching model for streaming motion generation, enabling high-level semantic intentions to be asynchronously in- jected into real-time gesture synthesis. Building upon this, we de- sign a dual-system architecture that decouples real-time reactive interaction (Behavioral System) from deliberative social reasoning (Cognitive System), enabling the agent to maintain conversational fluency while initiating contextually appropriate proactive behav- iors. The intention-conditioned motion generator serves as the tech- nical bridge, allowing the Cognitive System’s proactive decisions to seamlessly modulate the Behavioral System’s continuous motion stream. We deploy the complete system on a physical humanoid robot. User studies and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances perceived proactivity, natu- ralness, and u...

## Method / Approach (Snippets)
The goal of this work is to develop an agent that can grasp several objects based on the post-grasp intention that will be given as a conditional variable to the policy. We assume that the policy has access to the global pose of the object and the robot’s state. The goal of the agent is to lift the corresponding object from the table in front of it while taking into account its post-grasp intention. To achieve this we extract grasp data from a dataset of human grasp with different post-grasp intentions and then train a policy with reinforcement learning to exhibit the desired behaviour. A. Dataset pre-processing We rely on the dataset introduced in [1] which consists of 3D models of everyday objects annotated with contact maps captured from humans operators grapsing the objects with two different post grasp intentions: 1) using the object and 2) handing the object off to another person. The dataset also contains the hand posture, i.e. the 3D position of keypoints on the fingers of each subject, which was estimated through a 3D vision pipeline. We use two types of data in our work: 1) the grasp postures of the human subjects and 2) the grasp locations that they chose. Hand postures. Firstly, we retarget the grasp postures executed on the objects by the participants to the robotic hand by designing a fixed mapping function between the two kinematic chains. More specifically, for each joint we compute the angle defined by the adjacent points (red points in Figure 1) and we remap...

## Conclusion (Snippets)
In summary, we have presented an agent that is able to grasp several objects while taking into account a post grasp intention. The agent is trained on data collected from humans TABLE III: Average success rate for each policy for 5000 trials....

## Method / Approach (Snippets)
The proposed framework overview is illustrated in Fig.2. At its core, the control console is integrated with an inverse- mapping control strategy for manual wristed laparoscopic instruments, enabling precise hand-to-tool control mapping. A remote center of motion constraint on top of this in- verse mapping is applied to ensure keyhole positioning is unaffected by robot manipulation of the instruments. By coupling this natural manipulation paradigm with stereo vision feedback, the framework fully exploits the dexterity of humanoids while maintaining the intuitive ergonomics of conventional surgical robotic teleoperation. In the follow- ing sections, III-A covers the development of the whole system, and III-B details the derivation of general laparo- scopic tools’ inverse mapping control with Remote-Center- of-Motion (RCM) constraint. A. Humanoid Laparoscopic Teleoperation System As illustrated in Fig.2, this framework mounts two MTM modules [29] on a lightweight mobile platform to serve as the system’s control interface. The proposed design inte- grates all essential control components, including the control workstation, MTM modules, foot pedals, and stereo vision unit into a single compact platform. The vision module incorporates a dual-1920p endoscopic camera and a GOOVIS G3 Max head-mounted stereo display, enabling immersive visual feedback for laparoscopic procedures. On the humanoid side, the endoscope is mounted in front of the humanoid and streamed to the remote user to...

## Conclusion (Snippets)
In this work, we propose the first study on humanoid- based robotic surgery. We explore the feasibility of deploying humanoid + general laparoscopic instruments on surgical tasks, as a potential alternative to conventional surgical robot platforms with better deployability and accessibility. The experiment results demonstrate the proposed framework achieves operation accuracy comparable to the current gold standard dVRK, while significantly outperforming manual operation. Although the current system still trails the dVRK in terms of efficiency, this gap can be attributed to hardware design and control complexity. With continued refinement of tool integration and control strategy, humanoid-based surgical platforms hold strong potential to provide a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective alternative for advanced mini- mally invasive procedures....
